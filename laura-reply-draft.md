Hi Laura,

No worries at all -- glad things are busy!

Really pleased you like the wireframe, and thanks for filling in the questions and sending over those two reports. That's exactly what I needed.

## The "manual download" bit -- what does that actually mean?

Great question. This is the part where your team grabs the analytics numbers from each platform once a month. Every platform lets you download your data as a spreadsheet file -- you just need to know where the button is. Here's a quick rundown:

### Instagram & Facebook (via Meta Business Suite)

1. Go to **Meta Business Suite** (business.facebook.com)
2. Click **Insights** in the left menu
3. Choose the **Content** tab (or Audience, depending on what you need)
4. Click **Export** in the top-right corner
5. Pick your date range (e.g. 1 Jan -- 31 Jan) and select **CSV**
6. Hit **Download**

This covers both Instagram and Facebook in one place. You'll get a spreadsheet with reach, impressions, engagement, follower changes -- all the numbers you care about.

### TikTok

1. Open **TikTok Studio** (studio.tiktok.com) or the TikTok app
2. Go to **Analytics**
3. Select the date range you want
4. Click **Download Data** (top-right)
5. You'll get a CSV file

One thing to know: TikTok only lets you export the last 60 days at a time, so it's best to do this monthly before the oldest data drops off.

### LinkedIn

1. Go to your **LinkedIn Company Page** (admin view)
2. Click **Analytics** in the left menu
3. Choose the section (Content, Visitors, Followers)
4. Click **Export** in the top-right
5. Select the date range and download

LinkedIn exports as an Excel (.xls) file rather than CSV, but our tool will handle both formats.

### What your monthly routine would look like

Once the tool is built, the process for each client would be:

1. **Export** the files from each platform (2-3 minutes per platform)
2. **Drop** them into the client's folder (e.g. `Essex Sports Club/instagram/2026-02-metrics.csv`)
3. **Open the tool** and click **Sync All**

That's it. The tool reads all the new files, imports the data, and you can generate reports. For 16 clients across 3-4 platforms each, the export step is probably 15-20 minutes total per month. The folder structure keeps everything organised so you always know what's been uploaded and what's missing.

I know it sounds like a lot of steps written out, but once you've done it once or twice it becomes muscle memory. And I'll make a visual guide with screenshots for each platform so your team can follow along.

## Airtable -- great news

Really glad you mentioned Airtable! Since your team already uses it for content calendars, the plan is to **connect the tool directly to your Airtable bases** rather than building a separate calendar. That way:

- Your team keeps planning content in Airtable exactly as you do now
- The analytics tool **reads your Airtable calendar** and overlays performance insights (best posting times, content type recommendations)
- After posts go live, the tool can **write engagement data back** to Airtable so you can see how each post actually performed

No workflow disruption -- just extra intelligence layered on top of what you're already doing.

I'd love to take you up on the offer to share a client calendar via Teams. Seeing your actual Airtable setup will help me design the connection properly (field names, statuses, how you organise things, etc.).

## Reports

Thanks for the Intotum and SCC reports -- I'll study those closely. I noticed they're in PowerPoint format. Would you prefer the new tool to generate **PowerPoint** reports (matching what clients already receive) or **PDF**? Happy to do either.

## Next steps

1. **Let's get that Teams call booked** -- I'll send over some availability
2. **Share an Airtable calendar** when you get a chance (any client is fine)
3. **Sample CSV exports** -- if you could do one test export from Instagram, Facebook, or TikTok for any client and send the file over, that would help me build the data parsers. No rush on this.

And thank you -- I'll pass on what you said about the documentary, he'll be chuffed!

Speak soon,
Mark

*Notes for Mark (not for sending):*
- Laura asked about pricing/compensation -- discuss on the Teams call
- Need to check what Airtable plan she's on (free has 1,000 record limit)
- The PPTX reports need reviewing to understand layout and metrics used
- "Views" was ranked #1 but needs clarification on which platforms this refers to
